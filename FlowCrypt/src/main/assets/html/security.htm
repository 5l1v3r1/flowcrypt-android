    <h1>FlowCrypt Security</h1>

    <p style="color: red;">Warning: this is an Alpha release of FlowCrypt. It may not work as intended, crash, or
        contain security bugs.</p>

    <p>FlowCrypt uses strong end-to-end encryption, meaning only you and your intended recipients
        will be able to read content of your encrypted messages. It's designed so that no unintended
        parties can read your email, including your email provider, your recipient's email provider,
        FlowCrypt developers or anyone else.</p>

    <p>Your email access token, pass phrases and other sensitive material stays stored on your
        device. It will not be shared with FlowCrypt developers or anyone else.</p>

    <p>Please send me your questions to tom@flowcrypt.com</p>
