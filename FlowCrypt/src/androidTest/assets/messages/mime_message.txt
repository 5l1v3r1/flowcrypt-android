With the Android P Developer Preview now available, we have a much better =
idea about what to expect.=C2=A0We explain when and what we expect to see =
from Android 9.0, which may or may not be called Pistachio Ice Cream.

You may be viewing an older version of this story cached by Google,=
=C2=A0click here to see the latest version of this story.

How to get the Android P Developer Preview

Released in early March, the Android P Developer Preview is available only =
to the Pixel, Pixel XL, Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL. You can=C2=A0download the =
Android P system imageand flash it to your device, or=C2=A0run Android P in=
 an emulator.

If you do decide to flash the Developer Preview, to revert to your current =
OS you'll need to=C2=A0flash=C2=A0a factory image.

We aren't providing step-by-step instructions because the Developer Preview=
 is not intended for normal users. A consumer preview will be available =
soon, likely at Google I/O in May. We'd strongly recommend waiting until =
then to try the latest features.

What will Android 9.0 be called?

Since the early days of Android updates have been named after sweet treats =
and in alphabetical order. So far we've seen:

Android Donut (v1.6)Android Eclair (v2.0)Android Froyo (v2.2)Android =
Gingerbread (v2.3)Android Honeycomb (v3.0)Android Ice Cream Sandwich (v4.=
0)Android Jelly Bean (v4.1)Android KitKat (v4.4)Android Lollipop (v5.=
0)Android Marshmallow (v6.0)Android Nougat (v7.0)Android Oreo (v8.0)

In 2018 we should see Android 'P' launch as Android 9.0. The name won't be =
announced until the summer, but that doesn't stop us having a guess as to =
what it could be.

There are already=C2=A0rumours=C2=A0the name could be Android Pie, Android =
Pecan Pie or Android Pumpkin Pie, thanks to=C2=A0a reference to Android Pi =
within the Android Open Source Project. But that doesn't sound very Google.=


Google Developers have also begun dropping hints on Twitter, and the binary=
 code pictured takes you to the google.com/io website where you'll be able =
to use Street View to explore the reception area of a Google Developer's =
building. There are various puzzles to solve, and locked away in a second =
room=C2=A0you'll find a Pineapple Cake. Could we be looking at Android =
Pineapple?

Plans are coming along for=C2=A0#io18=E2=80=A6=C2=A0pic.twitter.=

More recently sources are pointing to Android Pistachio Ice Cream, which is=
 apparently what Google is calling the upcoming OS internally. It fits the =
usual sweet-treat requirement, and from previous OS names we know Google =
likes ice cream. But pistachio? What about all the nut-allergy sufferers?

Our favourite is Android Popsicle, but vote in our poll below and add any =
other ideas to the comments at the bottom of this page.

When is Android 9.0 coming out?

A consumer preview of Android 9.0 will most likely be announced =
during=C2=A0Google I/O 2018, which we expect to take place in mid-May, =
potentially 16-18 May 2018. As before with Oreo the developer preview was =
announced earlier in March.

A=C2=A0few public betas will follow, and we expect to see the final =
consumer release in August 2018.

When will my phone get Android 9.0?

Although Android 9.0 will be released in August 2018, it won't be =
immediately available to all Android devices. The update will first be =
available to Google Pixel devices, and then we'll start to see new phones =
arriving with Android P out of the box at September's IFA 2018 show.

Android updates are rolled out by phone manufacturers and network operators=
 rather than Google itself, because any Android updates must first be =
tweaked to work with any customisations they have made.=C2=A0

Those with vanilla interfaces - such as Nokia, which has already confirmed =
Android P updates for all 2017 phones - will be among the first to roll out=
 the update, then the likes of Samsung, LG, Sony and HTC will begin rolling=
 out Android 9.0 in late 2018/early 2019.

OTA updates, when they do arrive, are expected to download and install =
faster and use less data thanks to Google's Brotli compression algorithm.

There's also no guarantee that your device will be updated to Android 9.0 =
(see=C2=A0how to update Android). Device fragmentation is still a problem =
for the OS, and at the last count (by=C2=A0Android Developers) on 5 =
February there were still devices running version 2.3.3 Gingerbread.

What new features to expect in Android 9.0

According to Android Developers, key new features in Android P include:

Simplicity, speed, and many new ways to extend your apps

MessagingStyle and other notification updates

ImageDecoder for bitmaps and drawables

Data cost sensitivity in JobScheduler

Display cutout APIs

Multi-camera APIs

(For full details see the video at the top of this page.)

There=C2=A0had been very few rumours as to what we can expect from Android =
P, though XDA suggests Google will remove access to unofficial =
APIs=C2=A0(those not part of the official SDK) - news that will upset some =
developers.

Other changes we can expect to see in the upcoming update, according to the=
 enthusiast site, include support for Wi-Fi Direct Printing support and =
Bluetooth hearing aids, and better integration for=C2=A0Android Things.

The new OS will also prevent malicious apps running in the background from =
accessing your camera and mic in order to spy on you, according =
to=C2=A0AOSP. We'll have to wait and see how this affects anti-theft apps, =
a consideration pointed out by Slashgear.

One potential new feature is to do with smaller image file sizes. In iOS 11=
 Apple introduced=C2=A0HEIC files, which are also known as=C2=A0HEIF or =
High Efficiency Image Format.=C2=A0It=E2=80=99s the still image version of =
HEVC, which is the latest video codec. It makes for Jpeg images just 50 =
percent of their previous size, can store image edits and =
multiple=C2=A0photos in one file (think Live Photo and burst mode), and it =
supports transparency and 16-bit colour.

HEIC is not a proprietary image format developed by Apple itself, so =
there's every possibility Google could opt for the same format. However, =
Google is also working with the Alliance for Open Media on its own version =
that is currently able to create images 15 percent smaller than HEIC. It =
would make sense to use the better version, of course, but for now the =
project is very much in its infancy. Whether it will be ready for Android 9=
.0 we simply don't know.

According to=C2=A0Bloomberg,=C2=A0Android is also set to be adapted to =
support phones with a 'notch' design, as introduced by the iPhone X.=
=C2=A0The upcoming OS will also support foldable displays, such as that of =
the Galaxy X, and devices with multiple displays.

Increased call blocking is another possibility, according to=C2=A0XDA, =
where users will even be able to block private numbers, pay phones and =
numbers that either have no ID or aren't in your contacts list.
